    /// The system handles each icon and cursor as a single file. However, these are stored in
    /// .res files and in executable files as a group of icon resources or a group of cursor
    /// resources. The file formats of icon and cursor resources are similar. In the .res file
    /// a resource group header follows all of the individual icon or cursor group components.
    /// 
    /// The format of each icon component closely resembles the format of the .ico file. Each
    /// icon image is stored in a BITMAPINFO structure followed by the color device-independent
    /// bitmap (DIB) bits of the icon's XOR mask. The monochrome DIB bits of the icon's AND
    /// mask follow the color DIB bits.
    /// 
    /// The format of each cursor component resembles the format of the .cur file. Each cursor
    /// image is stored in a BITMAPINFO structure followed by the monochrome DIB bits of the
    /// cursor's XOR mask, and then by the monochrome DIB bits of the cursor's AND mask. Note
    /// that there is a difference in the bitmaps of the two resources: Unlike icons, cursor
    /// XOR masks do not have color DIB bits. Although the bitmaps of the cursor masks are
    /// monochrome and do not have DIB headers or color tables, the bits are still in DIB
    /// format with respect to alignment and direction. Another significant difference
    /// between cursors and icons is that cursors have a hotspot and icons do not.
    /// 
    /// The group header for both icon and cursor resources consists of a NEWHEADER structure
    /// plus one or more RESDIR structures. There is one RESDIR structure for each icon or
    /// cursor. The group header contains the information an application needs to select the
    /// correct icon or cursor to display. Both the group header and the data that repeats for
    /// each icon or cursor in the group have a fixed length. This allows the application to
    /// randomly access the information.
