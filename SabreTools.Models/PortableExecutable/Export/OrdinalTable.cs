    /// The export name pointer table and the export ordinal table form two parallel arrays that are
    /// separated to allow natural field alignment. These two tables, in effect, operate as one table,
    /// in which the Export Name Pointer column points to a public (exported) name and the Export
    /// Ordinal column gives the corresponding ordinal for that public name. A member of the export
    /// name pointer table and a member of the export ordinal table are associated by having the same
    /// position (index) in their respective arrays.
    /// 
    /// Thus, when the export name pointer table is searched and a matching string is found at position
    /// i, the algorithm for finding the symbol's RVA and biased ordinal is:
    /// 
    ///     i = Search_ExportNamePointerTable(name);
    ///     ordinal = ExportOrdinalTable[i];

    ///     rva = ExportAddressTable[ordinal];
