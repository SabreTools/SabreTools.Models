    /// Auxiliary Format 3: Weak Externals
    /// 
    /// "Weak externals" are a mechanism for object files that allows flexibility at
    /// link time. A module can contain an unresolved external symbol (sym1), but it
    /// can also include an auxiliary record that indicates that if sym1 is not
    /// present at link time, another external symbol (sym2) is used to resolve
    /// references instead.
    /// 
    /// If a definition of sym1 is linked, then an external reference to the symbol
    /// is resolved normally. If a definition of sym1 is not linked, then all references
    /// to the weak external for sym1 refer to sym2 instead. The external symbol, sym2,
    /// must always be linked; typically, it is defined in the module that contains
    /// the weak reference to sym1.
    ///
    /// Weak externals are represented by a symbol table record with EXTERNAL storage
    /// class, UNDEF section number, and a value of zero. The weak-external symbol
    /// record is followed by an auxiliary record with the following format:
