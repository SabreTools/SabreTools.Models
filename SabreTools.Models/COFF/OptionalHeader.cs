    /// do not have it. For image files, this header is required. An object file can have
    /// an optional header, but generally this header has no function in an object file
    /// except to increase its size.
    /// 
    /// Note that the size of the optional header is not fixed. The SizeOfOptionalHeader
    /// field in the COFF header must be used to validate that a probe into the file for
    /// a particular data directory does not go beyond SizeOfOptionalHeader.
    /// 
    /// The NumberOfRvaAndSizes field of the optional header should also be used to ensure
    /// that no probe for a particular data directory entry goes beyond the optional header.
    /// In addition, it is important to validate the optional header magic number for format
    /// compatibility.

    /// 2 gigabytes. Other PE32+ modifications are addressed in their respective sections.
